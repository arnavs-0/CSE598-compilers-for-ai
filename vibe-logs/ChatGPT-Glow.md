Walk me through Glow, why did it get deprecated at the end?

## Response:
Here’s a walk-through of **Glow** (the compiler for neural-network hardware accelerators under the PyTorch umbrella), what it aimed to do, and why it appears to have been deprecated/archived.

* * *

What Glow was and how it worked
-------------------------------

1.  Glow is a machine-learning compiler and execution engine developed under the PyTorch project. [GitHub+3GitHub+3GitHub+3](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Its goal: take high-level neural network graphs (from frameworks like PyTorch) and compile them into efficient code for different hardware accelerators (CPUs, GPUs, custom backends). [GitHub+1](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Architecture: It uses a multi-phase lowering:
        *   High-level intermediate representation (IR) capturing the graph and optimization opportunities. [GitHub+1](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        *   Then a lower-level IR/instruction form for memory- and hardware-specific optimizations (scheduling, copy elimination, etc). [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Example use case: It was used to compile e.g. ResNet50 (quantized & non-quantized) into native code bundles. [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Targeting low-power and embedded/accelerator environments was one of the motivating directions. [Medium](https://medium.com/pytorch/glow-compiler-optimizes-neural-networks-for-low-power-nxp-mcus-e095abe14942?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2.  Why this kind of compiler matters:
    *   Hardware is increasingly heterogeneous (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, mobile accelerators), and deploying neural nets efficiently across them demands optimizing beyond just “run on GPU”.
    *   A compiler like Glow can provide vendor-agnostic lowering and optimize memory/time/performance trade-offs.
    *   Prior compilers (e.g., XLA for TensorFlow) had shown the benefits of such abstraction layers.
3.  Advantages and features of Glow:
    *   Multi-target support: by lowering complex operators into simpler primitives, it reduced the “implement operator X for every backend” burden. [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation: instead of entirely dynamic interpretation, Glow can produce native binaries or bundles. [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   It was part of the broader PyTorch ecosystem, so conceptually aligned with PyTorch’s goals of performance, flexibility, and community contributions.

* * *

Why Glow appears to have been deprecated / archived
---------------------------------------------------

The repository for Glow was archived by the owner on **July 1, 2025** and is now read-only. [GitHub+1](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
Here are the likely reasons _why_ this happened (while not all explicitly documented, the available clues suggest a combination of factors):

1.  **Shift in ecosystem and priority**
    *   The PyTorch ecosystem has evolved: With PyTorch-2.x, the tooling around compilation, graph-mode, JIT, and native runtime support has advanced a lot. Resources may have shifted to newer compiler paths or integrated frameworks rather than separate projects.
    *   The PyTorch Foundation (April/May 2025) announced its expansion to host broader “umbrella” projects (see the blog: the foundation growing, focusing on core and ecosystem). [PyTorch+1](https://pytorch.org/blog/pt-foundation-expands/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   In a way, it might simply be that Glow, while ambitious, no longer aligned with the community’s “killer path” for production model deployment, and maintaining a distinct compiler project requires significant resources.
2.  **Maintenance burden & limited adoption**
    *   Large-scale compiler projects are hard to maintain: each new hardware backend, each new operator, quantization scheme, memory model, etc adds cost.
    *   In the issues list of the repo, there is an issue titled _“Sunsetting Glow Active Development”_. [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/glow/issues?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Possibly the contributor community, or maintainers, decided the return on investment did not justify ongoing active development for that standalone repo.
3.  **Consolidation of compilation infrastructure**
    *   The strategy for deploying ML models may have shifted to other tools (e.g., TorchInductor, FX Graphs, ONNX backends, vendor-specific toolchains). Glow may have overlapped with or been superseded by other efforts.
    *   The design of PyTorch itself has strongly moved toward “compile or trace” workflows, which might reduce the need for a separate generic compiler like Glow.
4.  **No major announcement, but archival is the signal**
    *   There does _not_ appear to be a blog post that says “Glow is deprecated because X”. But the archive status on GitHub is a strong signal that the maintainers intend no further features.
    *   “Archived by the owner … now read-only.” [GitHub+1](https://github.com/pytorch/glow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   The issue list still has open issues (including #6135 related to sunsetting). [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/glow/issues?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
5.  **Ecosystem overlap & viability**
    *   Support for many hardware backends and frameworks is difficult — possibly the user base for Glow was more niche (embedded, custom hardware accelerators) and maybe the broader PyTorch community focused more on ease of use, Python APIs, dynamic execution, rather than heavy compiler optimization.
    *   When a project is “mature” but no longer evolving, archiving can be a way for maintainers to redirect attention to new areas.

* * *

What this means for users / what to watch out for
-------------------------------------------------

*   If you are using Glow now or planning to, treat it as **archived** (no further active development). Bugs, security patches, new hardware support may not be forthcoming.
*   If you are building new deployments of PyTorch models and need compiler/inference support, consider alternative or upstream-supported tools: for example the PyTorch native compilation pathways, vendor toolchains (e.g., NVIDIA TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, etc), or other community projects.
*   If you have code built on Glow, you may want to plan migration: examine where Glow was used (backends, optimizations) and test whether newer toolchains give equivalent or better performance/compatibility.
*   Archival doesn’t mean the code disappears — you can still fork or use it—but you should gauge risk (especially for production) of depending on an unmaintained project.

* * *

If you like, I can check **exact statements** (or mailing list discussions) from the PyTorch team about the decision to archive Glow (to confirm/clarify the reasoning). Would you like me to dig that?

## Prompt:
walk me through glow? how does it work?

## Response:
Absolutely — let’s walk through **Glow**, how it’s designed, and how it works _step by step_, from input neural network to optimized machine code.

* * *

🧠 1. What Glow Is
------------------

**Glow** (short for _Graph Lowering_) is Facebook’s / PyTorch’s **machine learning compiler** designed to efficiently run neural networks on **heterogeneous hardware** (CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, or custom accelerators).

It doesn’t _train_ networks — it _compiles_ them.  
That means: it takes a model graph (say from PyTorch or ONNX) and turns it into **optimized executable code** for a specific device.

* * *

⚙️ 2. The High-Level Idea: "Graph Lowering"
-------------------------------------------

Traditional frameworks (like early TensorFlow or PyTorch eager mode) executed each operator node by node.  
That’s flexible but inefficient — no global view for optimization, and heavy runtime overhead.

Glow solves this by compiling the entire compute graph down to optimized code in **two main IR (Intermediate Representation)** layers:

1.  A **high-level graph IR** (domain-specific, tensor-based)
2.  A **low-level instruction IR** (address-based, like assembly)

The “**lowering**” in Glow means transforming higher-level neural ops (like _Conv2D_, _BatchNorm_, _ReLU_) into smaller sets of **linear algebra primitives** (like _matrix multiply_, _add_, _max_, _reshape_), and then into low-level instructions.

That’s the heart of Glow:

> **Break complex operators into simpler, universal primitives** so every hardware backend doesn’t need to reimplement every op.

* * *

🧩 3. Compilation Pipeline (Step-by-Step)
-----------------------------------------

Glow’s pipeline looks roughly like this:

### Step 1: **Load the Graph**

*   Import from PyTorch or ONNX model → build an internal compute graph.
*   Each node = an operation, e.g. Conv, ReLU, Add.
*   Each edge = tensor data dependency.

### Step 2: **Differentiate (Optional)**

*   If you’re training (not just inference), Glow can automatically differentiate the graph to produce gradients.

### Step 3: **High-Level Optimization**

*   The graph is analyzed and optimized using domain-specific rules.
    *   Fuse operations (e.g., BatchNorm + Conv).
    *   Remove redundant Transposes.
    *   Eliminate dead nodes or constants.
*   Strongly typed: every tensor’s shape and type (float, int8, etc.) is known.

### Step 4: **Node Lowering**

*   Glow converts high-level nodes into a smaller set of **linear algebra primitives**.
    *   Example: `FullyConnected = MatMul + Add`
    *   Example: `BatchNorm = Mul + Add`
*   Result: fewer unique ops to implement per backend.

👉 **Why this matters:** instead of writing “Conv2D”, “Conv3D”, “FC”, etc., for every device, the backend just needs efficient kernels for basic building blocks (MatMul, Add, Max, etc.).

### Step 5: **Quantization (Optional)**

*   Glow supports **8-bit quantization** for efficient inference on embedded/low-power hardware.
*   It runs a “profile-guided quantization” step:
    1.  Insert profiling nodes to capture tensor ranges.
    2.  Run inference once to gather range stats.
    3.  Recompile network converting float ops to int8 using per-layer scales/offsets.

* * *

🧮 4. Low-Level IR (Instruction IR)
-----------------------------------

After lowering and optimization, Glow transforms the graph into a **low-level IR**.

This looks a bit like assembly for tensors — instructions operate on buffers by address.

**Example:**

```text
%conv = convolution [5 1 2 16] @out %allo, @in %input, @in %filter, @in %bias
%relu = max0 @out %allo0, @in %allo
%pool = pool max [3 3 0] @out %allo2, @in %allo0
```

Each instruction:

*   Reads/writes known memory buffers
*   Has clear input/output type annotations
*   Can be scheduled, fused, or optimized

At this stage Glow can:

*   **Fuse** data-parallel ops (e.g., Add + ReLU)
*   **Allocate memory statically** (one big buffer, no mallocs)
*   **Schedule instructions** to hide memory latency

* * *

💻 5. Backends (Code Generation)
--------------------------------

Now Glow can hand off to hardware-specific backends.

### CPU Backend Example

*   Uses LLVM to emit x86/ARM code.
*   Has a small internal **libjit** (standard library of kernels for ops like Conv, MatMul).
*   Performs **operator stacking** (fusing data-parallel ops to reuse memory and caches).
    *   Example: ReLU + Add + Sub fused into one SIMD loop.

**Generated Assembly Example:**

```asm
vaddps 6422528(%rcx,%rax,4), %ymm1, %ymm1
vmaxps %ymm0, %ymm1, %ymm1
vmovaps %ymm1, 6422528(%rcx,%rax,4)
```

→ Add and ReLU (max) fused into one vectorized loop.

### Accelerator Backends

*   Glow can target DSPs, NPUs, or custom chips.
*   Backends define their own instruction emitters.
*   Glow handles graph lowering, scheduling, and memory allocation automatically.

* * *

🧰 6. Runtime and Execution
---------------------------

Glow also provides a **runtime** for managing models and devices.

It includes:

*   **Partitioner** → Splits large models into subgraphs for multiple accelerators.
*   **Provisioner** → Assigns and loads subgraphs onto devices.
*   **Executor** → Handles async inference requests and orchestrates dependencies.

This allows Glow to manage multi-device setups efficiently (e.g., running different subgraphs on multiple NPUs).

* * *

📊 7. Evaluation & Performance
------------------------------

In their paper:

*   On CPU, Glow achieved **up to 2.7× faster** inference vs TensorFlow (with XLA) and **1.3× faster** vs TVM (without tuning).
*   Glow’s efficiency came from direct convolution lowering (avoiding im2col) and better memory scheduling.

* * *

🧩 8. Summary: Why Glow Was Unique
----------------------------------

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High-Level IR | Graph of neural ops | Conv, ReLU, FC |
| Node Lowering | Convert to basic primitives | MatMul, Add |
| Low-Level IR | Instruction-like ops | memory ops, fused arithmetic |
| Backend | Emit target code | LLVM, DSP, NPU |
| Runtime | Manage devices | partition, provision, execute |

✨ **Key idea:** Lower once, optimize everywhere.  
You write one model, Glow lowers and optimizes it for any hardware backend.

* * *

Would you like me to illustrate the **end-to-end flow** (from PyTorch → Glow → LLVM IR → CPU machine code) in a diagram or pseudocode form next? That helps visualize the compilation path.

## Prompt:
so how does this compare to mlir? why was mlir better?

## Response:
Excellent question — this is actually at the heart of _why Glow was eventually superseded_ by newer compiler infrastructures like **MLIR** (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation).

Let’s unpack this carefully — step by step.

* * *

🧠 1. What Both Glow and MLIR Try to Do
---------------------------------------

Both **Glow** and **MLIR** were born out of the same problem:

> Deep learning frameworks needed a compiler layer that could optimize and target heterogeneous hardware efficiently.

Both share the _multi-level lowering_ philosophy:

*   Start with **high-level graph representations** (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch graphs)
*   Apply **domain-specific optimizations**
*   Lower progressively into **low-level, hardware-specific instructions**

So conceptually:

> MLIR generalizes the exact same idea that Glow pioneered — but Glow was domain-specific, while MLIR is _infrastructure_.

* * *

⚙️ 2. Key Differences Between Glow and MLIR
-------------------------------------------

| Aspect | **Glow** | **MLIR** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Origin** | Facebook (for PyTorch) | Google (for TensorFlow, XLA, and beyond) |
| **Goal** | Efficiently compile neural networks for CPUs/accelerators | Provide a _general compiler framework_ for _any_ domain/language/hardware |
| **Scope** | Fixed domain: neural network graphs | Extensible: you can define _dialects_ for ML, HPC, quantum, etc. |
| **IR Design** | Two rigid levels (High-Level Graph IR → Low-Level Instruction IR) | Many hierarchical IRs; each _dialect_ defines its own ops and lowering rules |
| **Extensibility** | Hardcoded op sets (Conv, Add, MatMul…) | Plugin-style: define your own ops, types, and transformations |
| **Integration** | Tightly coupled to PyTorch ecosystem | Now the foundation of TensorFlow/XLA, IREE, TorchInductor, OpenXLA, etc. |
| **Backend Targeting** | Each backend must manually integrate with Glow’s runtime and instruction IR | MLIR lowers into LLVM, SPIR-V, or any backend using flexible conversion pipelines |
| **Community** | Small (mostly internal to Facebook / Meta) | Very large: LLVM, TensorFlow, PyTorch 2.0, IREE, ONNX-MLIR all use MLIR |

* * *

🧩 3. Architectural Comparison
------------------------------

### Glow:

*   🧱 **Two levels of IR**:
    *   **Graph IR** — strongly typed, high-level nodes.
    *   **Instruction IR** — address-based, like assembly.
*   🔄 **Fixed pipeline**: High-level → Lower → Optimize → Emit.
*   🎯 **Static structure**: Good for known models and fixed shapes.
*   ❌ **Hard to extend**: Adding new op types or data structures means modifying core compiler code.

### MLIR:

*   🪜 **Multiple levels of IR** (arbitrary depth):
    *   Example: `torch` dialect → `linalg` dialect → `affine` → `llvm` dialect.
*   🧩 **Composable dialects**: You can define new ops and progressively lower between dialects.
*   🔁 **Reusability**: Each compiler (like TensorFlow/XLA, IREE, or TorchInductor) can share infrastructure (SSA form, passes, bufferization, etc.).
*   🧠 **Unifies the ecosystem**: You don’t need separate compilers (Glow, XLA, TVM)—all can share MLIR’s passes and codegen layers.

* * *

🔍 4. Why MLIR Was _Better_ (Practically and Strategically)
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 1️⃣ **Generalized Infrastructure**

Glow was _a compiler_.  
MLIR is _a framework to build compilers_.

That means MLIR could serve **TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, JAX, IREE**, and even _non-ML_ domains.  
Glow could not — it was tightly coupled to neural networks.

→ **MLIR scaled across domains**, while Glow scaled only across backends.

* * *

### 2️⃣ **Extensibility via Dialects**

Glow’s IR was closed — to add a new operator, you had to patch the compiler core.  
In MLIR, you can define a new dialect (say `torch_audio`) with custom ops, types, and passes, without touching the rest of the system.

→ This made MLIR _future-proof_ and community-friendly.

* * *

### 3️⃣ **Interoperability & Modularity**

MLIR provides standardized interfaces:

*   Pass management
*   Pattern rewriting
*   SSA-based transformations
*   Dialect conversion pipelines

So different compiler stacks (like XLA, IREE, or TorchInductor) could interoperate and reuse passes.

Glow, on the other hand, had its **own IR**, **own optimizer**, **own runtime**, **own quantization**, and **own backend interface** — not reusable outside Glow.

→ MLIR unified the fragmented compiler ecosystem.

* * *

### 4️⃣ **Integration with LLVM Ecosystem**

MLIR is part of the LLVM project — it can lower into LLVM IR, SPIR-V, or GPU dialects directly.  
Glow also used LLVM under the hood, but it was just a backend — MLIR _absorbed_ that capability natively.

→ MLIR gave a more seamless path from high-level ops down to LLVM machine code.

* * *

### 5️⃣ **Adoption Momentum**

After 2019–2020, both TensorFlow and PyTorch shifted toward MLIR-based compilation:

*   TensorFlow/XLA was rewritten on top of MLIR.
*   PyTorch introduced **TorchDynamo**, **FX**, and **TorchInductor**, which all can use MLIR backends.
*   ONNX-MLIR and IREE became thriving ecosystems.

Meanwhile, Glow remained niche, primarily for specialized accelerators.

→ Eventually, maintaining a _Glow-only compiler stack_ didn’t make sense when MLIR provided a shared, extensible foundation.

* * *

🧰 5. Example: Same Concept, Different Realization
--------------------------------------------------

| Layer | Glow Equivalent | MLIR Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Neural graph (Conv, ReLU) | High-Level IR (Node graph) | Torch/TF Dialect |
| Linear algebra lowering | Node lowering → MatMul, Add | `linalg` Dialect |
| Memory & scheduling | Low-Level IR (Instructions) | `affine`, `bufferization` passes |
| Code generation | LLVM backend | LLVM Dialect or SPIR-V Dialect |

MLIR basically **absorbed the Glow pipeline**, but made every layer pluggable and reusable.

* * *

🪦 6. Why Glow Got Deprecated
-----------------------------

In short:

> Glow’s design was too _specific_ and too _monolithic_ for a world where MLIR existed.

*   The PyTorch team pivoted toward **TorchInductor** and **MLIR-based lowerings**.
*   Glow’s features (graph lowering, quantization, static memory planning) were valuable — but they could now live _inside MLIR pipelines_.
*   MLIR became the _industry standard infrastructure_ (adopted by LLVM, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.)
*   Maintaining Glow separately became redundant.

* * *

🧩 7. Summary: Why MLIR Won
---------------------------

| Feature | Glow | MLIR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Goal | Neural net compiler | General multi-level compiler IR |
| Extensibility | Hardcoded operators | Arbitrary dialects |
| Integration | Standalone | Part of LLVM ecosystem |
| Reuse | Closed system | Shared passes, pipelines |
| Adoption | Internal / limited | Broad industry adoption |
| Future | Archived (2025) | Core of PyTorch, XLA, IREE |

* * *

### 🔑 **In essence:**

Glow was a brilliant prototype for domain-specific compilation —  
MLIR **generalized Glow’s architecture** and made it _the infrastructure everyone could share._

* * *

Would you like me to show a visual diagram comparing **Glow’s two-level pipeline** vs **MLIR’s dialect stack (e.g., Torch → Linalg → Affine → LLVM)**? It’s an intuitive way to see why MLIR scales better.

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
![Generated image](https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/estuary/content?id=file_0000000081c46230a43562d2074d5808&ts=489329&p=fs&cid=1&sig=b6d2ed5ff67cda0a212d04350b68c960e3760d2a181a43629d9a1c8ba1e545ce&v=0)

## Prompt:
so if I were to bring back glow, what would I change?

## Response:
That’s a fantastic systems-engineering question — and one that would make an excellent design exercise for a modern compiler engineer.

If you were to **revive or modernize Glow**, here’s what you’d want to change so it could compete in the ML compiler landscape of 2025:

* * *

🧠 1. Make Glow _Modular_ — Not Monolithic
------------------------------------------

**Old Glow:** fixed two-stage IR (Graph → Instruction), hard-coded passes and operators.  
**Problem:** Adding new ops or lowering paths required changing core code.

**Change:**

*   Rebuild Glow’s IR system using a **dialect-style architecture** (inspired by MLIR).
*   Define small, pluggable IR layers: `graph`, `tensor`, `affine`, `memory`, `llvm`.
*   Each backend or domain can register its own dialect and lowering rules dynamically.

👉 _Goal:_ Make Glow a **compiler framework**, not just a neural-net compiler.

* * *

🧩 2. Integrate With MLIR Instead of Replacing It
-------------------------------------------------

Rather than competing, **embed Glow as an MLIR frontend**:

*   Keep Glow’s strong ideas — _graph lowering_, _quantization_, _static memory planning_.
*   Implement them as **MLIR dialects and passes** (`glow.graph`, `glow.quant`, `glow.runtime`).
*   That way you get all the MLIR infrastructure (pattern rewriter, pass manager, SSA, LLVM lowering) for free.

👉 _Goal:_ Reuse MLIR’s backbone but bring back Glow’s specialized compiler expertise.

* * *

⚙️ 3. Redesign the Runtime Layer
--------------------------------

**Old Glow Runtime:** tightly coupled, bespoke partitioning/provisioning/execution engine.  
**Change:**

*   Replace with a **modular runtime abstraction** (like IREE’s HAL or PyTorch’s Runtime API).
*   Let accelerators plug in drivers that declare memory limits, concurrency, and latency models.
*   Support **asynchronous scheduling** and multi-device pipelines via a DAG executor.

👉 _Goal:_ Glow runtime becomes a pluggable orchestrator, not a custom monolith.

* * *

📦 4. Upgrade Quantization and Data Layout Handling
---------------------------------------------------

**Old Glow:** static profile-guided int8 quantization with fixed scale/offset scheme.  
**Change:**

*   Add **learned quantization** and **mixed-precision inference** (INT4, BF16, FP8).
*   Introduce a **quant dialect** with canonical rescaling ops that can be folded or fused.
*   Support layout polymorphism (e.g., NHWC, NCHW, blocked tensors) at the IR level.

👉 _Goal:_ match modern hardware’s mixed-precision pipelines.

* * *

🚀 5. Add Dynamic Shape and Control-Flow Support
------------------------------------------------

Glow’s strict typing and fixed tensor shapes made it inflexible for dynamic workloads.  
**Change:**

*   Represent shapes as symbolic or affine expressions (`N`, `H`, `W`, `C`).
*   Implement partial evaluation to compile efficient code paths for dynamic inputs.
*   Add conditional and loop regions (like MLIR’s `scf` dialect).

👉 _Goal:_ Handle transformers, variable sequence lengths, and dynamic batching.

* * *

🧰 6. Strengthen Hardware Backends
----------------------------------

**Old Glow:** mainly CPU backend with LLVM, partial support for DSPs and accelerators.  
**Change:**

*   Rebuild backends as **plugins** using a clear ABI for codegen and scheduling.
*   Provide a **reference LLVM backend** plus APIs for vendor backends (NPU, FPGA).
*   Introduce cost-model-based scheduling (tiling, vectorization, memory reuse).

👉 _Goal:_ Backends are independently maintainable, like Vulkan drivers.

* * *

🧮 7. Leverage Modern Optimization Tools
----------------------------------------

*   Integrate **polyhedral optimization** for loops (through MLIR affine dialects).
*   Add **autotuning and cost models** (search or ML-based) for kernel scheduling.
*   Enable **profile-guided re-compilation** for adaptive workloads.

* * *

🧑‍💻 8. Improve Developer Experience
-------------------------------------

*   Provide Python APIs (like TorchDynamo + FX) for JIT integration.
*   Add textual IR and visualizers with SSA form and graph diffs.
*   Make the compiler embeddable into applications (think “Glow-Lite”).

* * *

🔑 9. Focus on a Niche: Embedded and Edge Devices
-------------------------------------------------

MLIR already dominates cloud-scale compilers (PyTorch/XLA/IREE).  
Glow could thrive again if it:

*   Targets **resource-constrained MCUs and NPUs** (like NXP, Qualcomm).
*   Optimizes for **static, quantized, latency-critical** models.
*   Focuses on **ahead-of-time compilation** and **tiny runtimes**.

👉 _Goal:_ Be the _IREE-for-embedded_ niche compiler.

* * *

✨ 10. Rebrand Glow as a “Lean MLIR-Based Edge Compiler”
-------------------------------------------------------

Modern Glow = lightweight, embeddable, MLIR-based compiler optimized for inference on small or heterogeneous devices.

* * *

### 🔧 Summary Table

| Problem (Old Glow) | Modern Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed 2-level IR | Dialect-based multi-level IR |
| Hardcoded ops | Extensible op registry |
| Static shapes only | Symbolic/dynamic shapes |
| Custom runtime | Pluggable runtime layer |
| Basic quantization | Learned & mixed precision |
| Manual backends | Modular plugin backends |
| CPU-centric | Edge & accelerator focus |
| Monolithic design | MLIR integration |

* * *

If you revived Glow this way, you’d basically create:

> **“Glow v2: a lightweight, MLIR-powered compiler for low-power inference.”**

Would you like me to sketch what the _new architecture diagram_ (Glow v2 built atop MLIR) could look like? It’d show how Glow could plug into the PyTorch → MLIR → LLVM stack.

## Prompt:
what competes with glow? what is something out there that is significantly better?

## Response:
Excellent question — and honestly, it’s _the_ question that defines why Glow became obsolete and what’s taken its place.

Let’s look at this in **three tiers** — the compilers that _did_ what Glow did, the compilers that _do it better now_, and _why they’re better._

* * *

🧩 1. Glow’s Domain — Where It Operated
---------------------------------------

Glow was a **graph-lowering compiler** — sitting _between_ the neural network framework (PyTorch, ONNX) and the hardware backend.  
Its job:

*   Take a _model graph_,
*   Lower it through IRs,
*   Generate efficient code for heterogeneous hardware (CPU, DSP, NPU).

So competitors fall into the same **“deep learning compiler / optimizer / inference runtime”** category.

* * *

⚙️ 2. Historical Competitors (2017-2020 Era)
--------------------------------------------

| Compiler | Origin | Summary | Comparison vs Glow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TensorFlow XLA** | Google | Compiles TensorFlow graphs into fused, device-specific executables. | Similar “whole-graph lowering” idea. Early XLA was static, but it evolved faster than Glow and gained TPU backend dominance. |
| **Apache TVM** | Amazon + UW + community | End-to-end deep learning compiler that auto-tunes kernels and emits code for CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators. | More flexible (search-based optimizations, tensor expression DSL). Glow had no autotuner. |
| **nGraph** | Intel | Intermediate representation & executor targeting MKL-DNN and other backends. | Very similar to Glow, but Intel-backed and integrated into OpenVINO. |
| **Tensor Comprehensions** | Facebook AI Research | DSL that searches for optimal CUDA schedules. | Complementary; Glow was graph-level, TC was kernel-level. |
| **DLVM** | Illinois / LLVM-based research project | Early general compiler for deep learning. | Conceptually similar, but less production-ready. |
| **Halide** | MIT | Not ML-specific, but inspired TVM. | Glow borrowed Halide’s lowering philosophy indirectly. |

🟢 **Glow’s advantage at the time:**

*   Tight PyTorch integration.
*   Strong static memory optimization.
*   Good quantization support.  
    🔴 **Its weakness:**
*   Rigid IR, limited extensibility, poor dynamic shape handling, no auto-tuning.

* * *

🚀 3. Modern Competitors (2022–2025+)
-------------------------------------

By 2025, Glow’s feature set has been _absorbed_ or _surpassed_ by more general and powerful compilers.

### 🧠 **1\. MLIR Ecosystem (LLVM / Google / PyTorch / IREE)**

*   **MLIR** is now the _infrastructure_ for almost all new compiler stacks.
*   Glow’s _two-level IR_ design is replaced by MLIR’s _multi-dialect hierarchy._
*   MLIR-based compilers:
    *   **TorchInductor** (PyTorch 2.0+)
    *   **XLA: Next Gen (OpenXLA)**
    *   **IREE** (Google’s portable runtime/compiler)
    *   **ONNX-MLIR**
    *   **StableHLO / MHLO dialects**

✅ **Why it’s significantly better:**

*   Flexible (add new ops via dialects)
*   Shared passes and optimizations
*   Unified ecosystem (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX)
*   Excellent GPU/TPU/Vulkan backends

Glow had to reinvent all of this itself — MLIR made it reusable.

* * *

### ⚡ **2\. PyTorch 2.0 Compiler Stack**

*   **TorchDynamo + FX + AOTAutograd + Inductor**
*   Compiles arbitrary PyTorch programs into optimized kernels.
*   Leverages **OpenAI’s Triton** to generate GPU code (auto-fused, auto-vectorized).
*   Optionally integrates MLIR for CPU and accelerator lowering.

✅ **Why it’s better:**

*   Fully dynamic (handles arbitrary control flow)
*   Integrated in PyTorch runtime
*   Generates custom fused CUDA kernels automatically
*   Supports training and inference

Glow, by contrast, was AOT (ahead-of-time) and mostly inference-only.

* * *

### 🔬 **3\. Apache TVM / OctoML**

*   TVM remains the most flexible open compiler for heterogeneous devices.
*   Has a **meta-scheduler** and **auto-tuning engine** to explore optimal kernel schedules.
*   Backend support: CPU, CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan, Metal, Hexagon, WebGPU.

✅ **Why it’s better:**

*   Uses machine learning to _learn optimal codegen_ per hardware.
*   Broad hardware support and automatic quantization.
*   Modular, community-driven IR and runtime.

Glow lacked TVM’s search-based optimization — its scheduling was static.

* * *

### 🧰 **4\. Google IREE**

*   MLIR-based compiler/runtime that can deploy TensorFlow, JAX, or TFLite models to mobile, desktop, and accelerators.
*   Compiles to **Vulkan, Metal, CUDA, and even embedded microcontrollers.**

✅ **Why it’s better:**

*   AOT _and_ JIT hybrid model
*   Lightweight runtime (<1 MB footprint)
*   Excellent edge support — exactly Glow’s old niche

Glow could’ve been this — but IREE did it, better, with MLIR.

* * *

### ⚙️ **5\. ONNX Runtime + ORT Mobile**

*   Cross-framework inference runtime using ONNX graphs.
*   Uses graph optimization and execution providers (CPU, CUDA, TensorRT, etc.).
*   Quantization and fusion built-in.

✅ **Why it’s better:**

*   Plug-and-play for any model exported to ONNX.
*   Supported by Microsoft and widely deployed.

Glow required integration at compile time; ONNX Runtime works post-export.

* * *

🧮 4. Which Is “Significantly Better”?
--------------------------------------

If we look strictly at what Glow _was supposed to be_ —  
a general-purpose AOT neural network compiler — the clear winners are:

| Category | Glow’s Equivalent | Modern “Significantly Better” |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PyTorch Integration | Glow | **TorchInductor + Triton** |
| Multi-level IR Infrastructure | Glow IR | **MLIR** |
| General Compiler Framework | Glow | **IREE / OpenXLA** |
| Hardware Auto-Optimization | Glow’s static scheduler | **TVM MetaScheduler** |
| Edge / Embedded Focus | Glow runtime | **IREE / ONNX Runtime Mobile** |

All of these **subsume Glow’s architecture**, but with better modularity, performance, and dynamic graph handling.

* * *

🔑 5. Why These Are Better in Practice
--------------------------------------

1.  **Extensibility:** MLIR dialects > fixed IR.
2.  **Dynamic Shapes:** TorchInductor & XLA handle dynamic tensors.
3.  **Auto-tuning:** TVM and Triton outperform static heuristics.
4.  **Unified Ecosystem:** MLIR acts as lingua franca between frameworks.
5.  **Deployment Ready:** IREE, OpenXLA, and ONNX Runtime are production-grade.
6.  **Community:** Active development across industry and academia; Glow’s maintainers moved on.

* * *

🧭 6. TL;DR
-----------

| Era | “Best-in-class” compiler | Why it outperformed Glow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | Glow | Innovative, efficient, static graph lowering |
| 2020 | TVM | Auto-tuning, broader hardware support |
| 2022 | MLIR | Infrastructure-level replacement |
| 2023+ | TorchInductor + Triton | Dynamic, integrated PyTorch compiler |
| 2024+ | IREE / OpenXLA | Unified, portable MLIR runtime |
| 2025 | MLIR ecosystem as a whole | Everything Glow tried to be — generalized and scalable |

* * *

So if you wanted to **“bring back” Glow**, you wouldn’t compete _against_ MLIR or TorchInductor — you’d **build on top of them**, targeting a niche (e.g., embedded inference, deterministic execution, quantized AOT deployment).

Would you like me to outline how Glow could be redesigned _specifically to outperform IREE or TVM_ in the embedded inference niche (say, <10 MB devices)?
