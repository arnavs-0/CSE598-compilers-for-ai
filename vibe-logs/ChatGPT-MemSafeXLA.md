## Response:
Here’s a clear walkthrough of the paper **“Memory Safe Computations with XLA Compiler” (Artem Artemev, Tilman Roeder, Mark van der Wilk, 2022)**:

* * *

### 🧩 **Core Idea**

Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are optimized for _speed_, not _memory_.  
As a result, memory-heavy algorithms (like kernel methods or kNN) easily overflow GPU memory.

The authors extend **XLA** (Accelerated Linear Algebra compiler) — used by TensorFlow and JAX — to make it **memory-aware**, automatically restructuring computations to fit within user-specified memory limits.

They call this enhanced version **eXLA**.

* * *

### 🚨 **Motivation**

*   Many ML algorithms are limited by **memory, not compute**.
*   GPUs terminate execution immediately when memory limits are exceeded.
*   Memory-efficient implementations exist but require **ugly, complex code**.
*   eXLA automates memory optimization at the **compiler level**, so users don’t need to rewrite algorithms.

**Example bottleneck cases:**

*   Pairwise matrix computations:  $O(n^2)$  memory (kNN, kernel methods, transformers)
*   Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (SGPR): memory grows quadratically with data.

* * *

### 🔍 **Related Work**

*   **Sharding / Model Parallelism:** Distribute tensors across devices (e.g., Mesh-TensorFlow, Tofu), but requires manual setup and more hardware.
*   **Compilers like TVM, Glow, XLA:** Optimize for _speed_, not memory.
*   **KeOps:** Does memory-efficient GPU kernel computation but requires rewriting algorithms using a custom API.

**eXLA’s advantage:**  
Works _transparently_ on existing TensorFlow/JAX code — no reimplementation.

* * *

### ⚙️ **Technical Contributions (Section 4)**

eXLA adds **new optimization passes** inside XLA’s pipeline to control memory:

#### **4.1 Match and Replace**

Detects common inefficient operations (e.g., Euclidean distance) and replaces them with algebraically equivalent, memory-light forms.

Example:  
Instead of expanding  $(x - y)^2$  → uses  $||x||^2 + ||y||^2 - 2x^Ty$ , reducing tensor size from  $n×m×d$  to  $n×m$ .

#### **4.2 Reordering**

Reorders operations in matrix chains to minimize memory use.

*   Example:  $C = A(Bv)$  uses far less memory than  $C = (AB)v$ .

#### **4.3 Data-Flow Graph Splitting**

Splits the computation graph into smaller chunks that fit in memory.

It:

1.  Searches the computational graph for large tensors (dots/reductions).
2.  Splits the graph along “splittable” dimensions.
3.  Reconstructs the result with a while loop (similar to MapReduce).

This lets the compiler run large matrix ops as a sequence of smaller ones.

Users specify limits via environment variables, e.g.:

```bash
XLA_FLAGS="--xla_tensor_size_threshold=1GB --xla_tensor_split_size=500MB" python train.py
```

#### **4.4 Limitations**

*   XLA’s type system doesn’t distinguish linear algebra objects (e.g., symmetric matrices).
*   Memory allocator isn’t yet aware of overall memory limits.
*   Must use smaller limits than total GPU memory to stay safe.

* * *

### 🧪 **Experiments**

#### **5.1 Matrix-Vector Multiplication**

Task:  $y = K v$ , where  $K$  is an  $n \times n$  kernel matrix.  
Without eXLA → memory ∝  $n^2$ .  
With eXLA → computation split into smaller chunks.

Result:

*   Can handle datasets requiring >8 TB (in theory) on a **32 GB GPU**.
*   Memory constraints respected; runtime increases modestly.

#### **5.2 k-Nearest Neighbours**

Brute-force kNN needs an  $m×n$  distance matrix.

Results:

*   eXLA prevents memory overflows in TensorFlow/JAX.
*   Comparable or better runtime.
*   **KeOps** is still faster overall but requires custom code.

#### **5.3 Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (SGPR)**

Traditional SGPR limited by  $O(nm + m^2)$  memory.

With eXLA:

*   Can automatically discover and apply the efficient splitting used in earlier hand-optimized work.
*   Scaled from 800 → 10,000 inducing points (previously impossible).
*   Achieved **better predictive performance** than advanced methods (e.g., Conjugate Gradient GP by Wang et al. 2019).

* * *

### 🧠 **Discussion**

*   eXLA lets existing algorithms scale **without rewriting code**.
*   Enables running models beyond previous hardware limits.
*   Example: Older algorithms (like SGPR) can outperform modern ones if allowed to scale.
*   Could make large models (e.g., transformers, NTKs) feasible on cheaper GPUs.

### 🧾 **In Summary**

| Aspect | Traditional XLA | eXLA Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Optimization focus | Speed | Memory safety + speed |
| User changes | Required (manual sharding) | None |
| Framework support | TensorFlow, JAX | Same |
| Key innovation | Graph splitting, memory thresholds | ✅ Automatic memory-aware transformations |

Would you like me to make a **diagram or flowchart** showing how eXLA’s compiler passes (match/replace → reorder → split) interact within the computational graph? It’d make the mechanism much clearer visually.

## Prompt:
so what is the point of this? What makes it better htan openxla

## Response:
Excellent question — and a nuanced one. Let’s unpack it carefully.

* * *

🧭 The Point of the Paper
-------------------------

The **goal** of _“Memory Safe Computations with XLA Compiler”_ (2022) is to fix a _blind spot_ in the original XLA compiler:

> **XLA optimizes for speed, not memory safety.**

They propose a **memory-aware version of XLA (eXLA)** that:

*   **Automatically adjusts** a program’s dataflow graph to fit within a user-specified memory limit.
*   **Prevents GPU out-of-memory (OOM)** errors at compile time.
*   **Doesn’t require any code changes** in TensorFlow or JAX models.

So, instead of you rewriting your algorithm or adding manual batching/sharding, the compiler transparently breaks up large tensor operations into smaller, memory-safe chunks.

Think of eXLA as:

> _“XLA, but with automatic memory-limit enforcement and tensor splitting built in.”_

* * *

⚙️ What It Actually Adds (Beyond XLA)
-------------------------------------

XLA already performs **speed optimizations** like:

*   Common subexpression elimination (CSE)
*   Operation fusion
*   Dead code elimination (DCE)

But **it doesn’t reason about memory footprint**.  
eXLA adds _three_ new optimization passes:

| Pass | What It Does | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Match & Replace** | Finds inefficient ops (e.g. naive distance calc) and replaces them with algebraically equivalent, smaller-memory versions. | Reduces temporary tensor creation. |
| **Reordering** | Reorders matrix chain multiplications to minimize intermediate tensor size. | Keeps large intermediates out of memory. |
| **Data-flow Graph Splitting** | Detects oversized tensors and automatically splits the computation graph into manageable slices. | Prevents OOM errors without code changes. |

This makes XLA memory-aware, not just compute-efficient.

* * *

⚔️ eXLA vs. **OpenXLA**
-----------------------

Now — **OpenXLA** (released 2023+) is the _next-generation_, open-source version of XLA maintained by Google, NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, etc.  
It provides a unified compiler stack for JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch/XLA.

Here’s the comparison:

| Feature | **eXLA (2022, research prototype)** | **OpenXLA (2023+, production compiler)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Goal** | Memory safety & transparent scaling | Cross-framework compiler & performance portability |
| **Focus** | Prevent OOM by splitting graphs | Backend performance & multi-hardware support |
| **Key innovation** | Memory-aware splitting & reordering passes | Unified IR (StableHLO), multi-backend support (GPU/TPU/CPU) |
| **User control** | Manual memory limit flag (`--xla_tensor_size_threshold`) | Automatic heuristics; no explicit memory budgeting |
| **Availability** | Research fork of TensorFlow’s XLA | Maintained open standard supported by major vendors |
| **Integration level** | Prototype layer inside XLA | Full ecosystem compiler stack (XLA + IREE + StableHLO) |

So:

*   **OpenXLA** modernizes the infrastructure and enables portability, but it **still lacks** a general-purpose **memory-aware optimization layer** like eXLA’s splitting heuristic.
*   **eXLA** directly tackles _“fit this computation in memory”_ as a compile-time constraint — something OpenXLA hasn’t fully automated (as of 2025).

* * *

💡 Why It Matters
-----------------

The paper’s insight is **conceptual**:

> Compilers can automatically make ML models memory-safe — the user shouldn’t have to think about GPU memory at all.

That’s the “point”: eXLA proves that memory management can be made **a compiler-level optimization**, not an algorithmic or user-level concern.

If OpenXLA eventually integrates similar passes (memory-aware scheduling, splitting, dynamic tensor budgeting), that would directly realize what this paper demonstrated as a prototype.

* * *

### 🧠 TL;DR

*   **eXLA:** A research prototype showing _how_ a compiler can prevent OOM by graph-level memory optimization.
*   **OpenXLA:** The industry-wide evolution of XLA for cross-platform performance — but not (yet) focused on automatic memory constraint enforcement.
*   **Point:** Demonstrates that we can scale classic algorithms (like Gaussian Processes) _without rewriting them_ — just by teaching the compiler to “think about memory.”

* * *

Would you like me to summarize how **eXLA’s ideas could be integrated into OpenXLA’s modern pipeline** (StableHLO → MLIR → backend)? It’d show exactly where such memory-splitting logic would fit today.

## Prompt:
so whats a comparable thing to this paper? What novelty does this have? Did the authors base this on an existing solution?

## Response:
Fantastic — you’re asking the right level of questions here.  
Let’s unpack this in three layers: what’s comparable, what’s new, and what it builds upon.

* * *

🧩 1. What’s Comparable to This Paper
-------------------------------------

The paper _“Memory Safe Computations with XLA Compiler”_ sits in the space of **compiler-based optimizations for machine learning frameworks**, so the closest comparable systems fall into two categories:

### 🔹 A. **Memory-efficient kernel libraries**

These aim to reduce memory use during linear algebra ops, but require _manual or semi-manual_ intervention:

| System | Key Idea | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **KeOps (Feydy et al., 2020; Charlier et al., 2021)** | Symbolic math expressions compiled into custom CUDA kernels that compute large kernel matrices in slices. | Requires user to **reimplement** computations using KeOps API; doesn’t integrate seamlessly into TensorFlow/JAX. |
| **GPyTorch’s KeOps backend (Wilson Lab)** | Uses KeOps for memory-efficient Gaussian Process computations. | Same: manual kernel definition; only works for certain operations. |
| **Tensor Comprehensions / TVM / Glow (2018)** | ML compilers that optimize tensor ops via kernel fusion and scheduling. | Focused on **speed**, not **memory footprint**. No automatic splitting of large tensors. |

➡️ So the most direct “competitor” to eXLA is **KeOps**, because both handle large kernel/matrix computations efficiently.  
The difference? **eXLA doesn’t require rewriting your code** — it automatically rewrites the _compiler’s intermediate representation (IR)_.

* * *

### 🔹 B. **Sharding and model-parallel frameworks**

These distribute tensors across multiple devices to fit large models in memory:

*   **Mesh TensorFlow** (Shazeer et al., 2018)
*   **Tofu** (Wang et al., 2019b)
*   **DeepSpeed** (Microsoft) and **Megatron-LM**

They handle large models by **increasing available memory** (more GPUs), rather than **using less memory**.  
eXLA, in contrast, works on _a single device_ by reducing peak memory footprint.

* * *

⚙️ 2. What’s the Novelty
------------------------

The key novelty is **where** the optimization happens — _inside the compiler IR (High-Level Optimizer)_, not the model code.

| Innovation | Why It’s Novel |
| --- | --- |
| **Compiler-level memory constraint enforcement** | Previous systems optimize compute time; eXLA introduces memory-awareness as a first-class compiler constraint. |
| **Automatic graph splitting** | Detects large tensor-producing ops (like `dot`, `reduce`) and inserts while-loops to process them in chunks. No prior compiler (XLA, TVM, Glow) had an automated splitting pass. |
| **Transparent user experience** | Works on existing TensorFlow/JAX code — no new APIs, unlike KeOps or sharding frameworks. |
| **Unified handling of forward + backward passes** | Because the whole computation graph (including gradients) is compiled together, eXLA automatically optimizes both. |
| **Empirical proof via scaling Gaussian Processes** | They show that old “non-scalable” GP methods become competitive once memory constraints are removed — a practical demonstration of compiler-level scalability. |

So:

> 🧠 The novelty is not a new algorithm, but a new _compiler-level mechanism_ for **automatic memory-constrained computation scheduling** in machine learning frameworks.

* * *

🧱 3. What It Builds On (Prior Work)
------------------------------------

The authors explicitly cite three main technical foundations:

1.  **XLA compiler (Leary & Wang, 2017)**  
    → The base system they extend. XLA already has passes for _speed_ (fusion, CSE, DCE), but not for memory safety.  
    eXLA adds _new passes_ to the existing optimization pipeline.
2.  **KeOps (Feydy et al., 2020)**  
    → Inspiration for memory-efficient linear algebra ops, but done via symbolic expression rewriting.  
    eXLA essentially _automates_ KeOps’ ideas inside the compiler, and works on full graphs instead of individual ops.
3.  **MapReduce / Graph Partitioning (Dean & Ghemawat, 2008; Wang et al., 2019b)**  
    → Conceptual basis for their “dataflow graph splitting”: breaking large computations into smaller ones.

They also reference:

*   **TVM** and **Glow** → similar compiler infrastructure, but not memory-aware.
*   **Linnea (Barthels et al., 2021)** → automatic generation of efficient linear algebra code; shows feasibility of algebraic optimization at compiler level.

* * *

🧠 In Short
-----------

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| **Comparable works?** | KeOps, TVM, Glow, Mesh TensorFlow, Tofu. |
| **What’s novel?** | Automatic, compiler-level memory-aware graph splitting and reordering — _no user rewriting_. |
| **What did it build on?** | XLA compiler infrastructure + KeOps-style slicing logic + MapReduce-inspired graph decomposition. |
| **What does it prove?** | That you can remove memory limits purely through compiler passes, not algorithmic redesign. |

* * *

If you’re looking for **academic analogues**, the closest research-level comparisons are:

*   **KeOps: Kernel operations on GPU without memory overflows (JMLR, 2021)** — similar motivation, user-level solution.
*   **Linnea (ACM TOMS, 2021)** — linear algebra compiler optimizations, but not memory constrained.
*   **TVM: End-to-end optimizing compiler for deep learning (OSDI, 2018)** — optimization framework, not memory-aware.

* * *

Would you like me to show a **timeline-style comparison chart** showing where eXLA fits relative to XLA (2017), TVM (2018), KeOps (2020), and OpenXLA (2023+)? It’d make the historical positioning of its novelty really clear.

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Perfect — here’s a **timeline-style comparison chart** showing where **eXLA** fits in the evolution of ML compilers and memory-efficient computation systems:

* * *

🕰️ **Timeline: Evolution of ML Compilers and Memory Optimization**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

| Year | System / Paper | Main Idea | Memory Awareness | User Effort | eXLA’s Relationship |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2017** | **XLA (Leary & Wang)** — _TensorFlow, compiled_ | JIT compiler for TensorFlow/JAX; fuses ops, removes redundant computation. | ❌ None (speed only) | None (transparent) | **Base system** that eXLA extends. |
| **2018** | **TVM (Chen et al.)** — _End-to-end optimizing compiler_ | Auto-tunes tensor kernels across devices for performance. | ⚠️ Limited (focus on throughput) | Medium (requires scheduling specs) | Inspired eXLA’s use of compiler-level IR passes. |
| **2018** | **Glow (Rotem et al.)** — _Graph lowering compiler_ | Converts NN graphs to low-level IR for backend-specific optimizations. | ❌ Focused on backend mapping, not memory. | Low | Shows trend toward compiler-based ML optimizations, but not memory-driven. |
| **2019** | **Tofu (Wang et al.)** — _Automatic dataflow partitioning_ | Splits large graphs across devices to support very large models. | ✅ Multi-device memory-aware, not per-device | Medium (needs distributed setup) | eXLA achieves similar splitting _within a single device_. |
| **2020** | **KeOps (Feydy et al.)** — _Kernel operations on GPU without memory overflows_ | Symbolic matrix expressions compiled into tiled CUDA kernels for memory efficiency. | ✅ Strong (manual symbolic slicing) | High (requires reimplementation) | eXLA automates KeOps-like slicing _in the compiler_. |

* * *

🧠 **Positioning Summary**
--------------------------

**Before eXLA:**

*   Compilers (XLA, TVM, Glow) focused on _speed and backend portability_.
*   Memory handling required **manual engineering** (e.g., KeOps, Tofu).

**eXLA’s Contribution (2022):**

*   Proved that **memory efficiency can be compiler-automated**.
*   Introduced **per-device, memory-aware graph splitting**.
*   Required **zero user modification**.
*   Enabled **old ML algorithms** (like sparse GPs) to scale purely through compilation.

**After eXLA (OpenXLA, 2023–2025):**

*   Broader industry collaboration; refactors XLA into an open standard (StableHLO, MLIR).
*   **Still missing** eXLA’s _automatic memory constraint optimization_ — a potential area for integration.

* * *

💬 **In One Line**
------------------

> **eXLA (2022)** was the first system to _teach a deep learning compiler to reason about memory as a constraint_, not just speed — bridging the gap between “auto kernel optimization” (TVM) and “memory tiling” (KeOps).

* * *

Would you like me to sketch this as a **visual timeline graphic** (with eras, arrows, and icons for each system) so you can use it in a presentation or paper summary?

## Prompt:
what are some of the weakness in this paper? Is it being widely adopted?

## Response:
Here’s a breakdown of some of the **weaknesses** or limitations of the _Memory Safe Computations with XLA Compiler_ paper, plus what I found about whether it’s being adopted (or likely to be) in practice.

* * *

⚠️ Key Weaknesses / Limitations
-------------------------------

The authors are pretty upfront about several constraints. Below are what I see as the most important weaknesses:

1.  **Weak Linear Algebra Type System**
    *   XLA represents matrices/tensors simply as multi-dimensional arrays without expressive types like “symmetric matrix”, “positive-semidefinite”, etc. This limits how many match-and-replace optimizations you can do, because you can’t always know what algebraic properties you have. [ar5iv+1](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2206.14148?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   As a result, some algebraic simplifications or “safe” rewrites may be unavailable because the compiler can’t verify the needed properties.
2.  **Memory Allocator / Buffer Scheduling Doesn’t Enforce Global Memory Limits**
    *   Even when tensor splitting is used to keep individual operations under a memory limit, the default allocator may still spawn multiple tensors (from different parts of the computation graph) that together exceed available memory. Because scheduling of when different nodes execute isn’t optimized for memory, the peaks can still overflow. [ar5iv+1](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2206.14148?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   So in practice, the authors sometimes needed to set the user’s memory‐limit flag **lower than** the actual GPU memory to be safe. In other words, there’s overhead and some conservatism required. [ar5iv+1](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2206.14148?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3.  **Runtime & Performance Overheads**
    *   Splitting operations, reordering, inserting while loops (for chunked computation) all introduce overhead in computation time (extra loops, smaller batch sizes, less parallelism, maybe less efficient memory access). The gains from avoiding OOM may offset these, but it’s a trade-off. The paper shows that in their experiments with GPs and kNN the overhead is “modest,” but in other settings with different hardware or workloads, it might be more significant. [arXiv+1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14148?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Also, certain operations might not be “splittable” or re-orderable without changing semantics, so the benefit isn’t universal.
4.  **Applicability / Generality**
    *   The paper demonstrates its approach mainly on linear algebra / kernel methods / Gaussian Processes / kNN. It claims transformers too, but the detailed experiments seem more focused on the former kinds of workloads. Some ML tasks may not benefit (or may benefit less) if their memory bottlenecks arise from other sources (e.g. embeddings, activations, irregular memory access, or dynamic shapes) where splitting or reordering is harder. [ar5iv+1](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2206.14148?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    *   Dealing with **dynamic shapes** is always harder, because you can’t always know the memory needed ahead of time; dynamic behavior may reduce the ability to split or pre-allocate well. The paper touches on what happens with dynamic behavior but doesn’t fully solve all cases. (This is a pretty general challenge.)
5.  **Integration & Ecosystem Adoption Challenges**
    *   Because it’s an _extension_ of XLA, it’s experimental/prototype. For people using stable versions of TensorFlow, JAX, or using OpenXLA / production stacks, it may not be part of `/ shipped by default` yet.
    *   Bugs, correctness under all edge cases (e.g. numerical stability when splitting matrices, numerical precision, etc.) may make practitioners cautious.
6.  **User Control vs Automation Tradeoff**
    *   Users must specify memory limits. So it’s not _zero configuration_ for best results; some tuning might be needed (deciding what threshold to set, how much headroom, etc.).
    *   Also, because of overheads, memory splitting might degrade performance if the limit is set too low.

* * *

📈 Is It Being Widely Adopted?
------------------------------

From what I saw, the picture is mixed. Here’s what I found out:

*   The work is relatively recent (2022). It’s been cited and discussed, but I did **not** find strong evidence that its specific compiler extension (eXLA) is widely deployed in mainstream frameworks _as of mid-2025_.
*   Some indications:
    *   The implementation is described in the paper / GitHub for TensorFlow + JAX using XLA. So those interested in kernel methods, GPs, etc., might have tried using it, especially academic users.
    *   I did _not_ find, in my search, documentation showing that OpenXLA (the more current, production/open-source branch of XLA) has integrated eXLA’s memory-aware splitting or manipulation based on user memory limits _as a standard feature_.
*   Challenges to adoption include:
    *   Integration into production-grade systems requires rigor: robustness, correctness, handling many edge cases, good default settings, managed overheads.
    *   Many users may not perceive the memory bottleneck in their workloads (or may already have ways to work around it, e.g., manual chunking, smaller batch sizes). So demand may be limited to particular use cases (GPs, large kernel computations, big attention layers, etc.).
    *   There’s inertia: compilers are delicate components; adding new optimization passes that transform dataflow, reorder operations, split tensors, etc., adds complexity, more opportunities for bugs, unpredictable performance for some workloads. So adoption tends to be slow.
*   Overall, I did **not** find evidence that eXLA is yet a de facto standard in XLA or a widespread built-in feature for many users. It seems more like an influential research prototype that shows “what could be done” rather than something already adopted broadly.

* * *

✅ Conclusion
------------

So, in summary:

*   The paper has solid novelty, and shows that compiler-level memory safety and automatic splitting is useful and feasible.
*   But it has limitations: type system restrictions, allocator/scheduler issues, performance overhead, partial applicability.
*   Adoption is not (yet) widespread — likely because integrating such features into production compilers is nontrivial, and many users have different trade-offs or different needs.

If you like, I can try to check very recent OpenXLA release notes (2024-2025) to see if eXLA-style features have been merged (“memory-constraint enforced compilation splitting,” etc.). Want me to dig that?

## Prompt:
Yes

## Response:
I searched through recent OpenXLA documentation, issue trackers, etc., to see if any features like the eXLA paper’s automatic graph‐splitting / memory constraint enforcement have been integrated. Here’s what I found, along with what seems still missing.

* * *

🔍 Evidence of Related Features in OpenXLA
------------------------------------------

These are features that touch on memory visibility, profiling, and memory-related optimization. Some are close in spirit to what eXLA proposes; others are more diagnostic.

| Feature | What It Offers | How Close It Is to eXLA-style Memory Safety / Splitting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Memory Viewer & Memory Profile tools** | OpenXLA provides a **Memory Viewer** (static) and **Memory Profile** (runtime) that visualize how much memory is used by buffers, temporaries, etc. Helps users debug OOMs. [OpenXLA Project+1](https://openxla.org/xprof/memory_viewer?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Good for visibility and debugging; _not_ a substitute for automatic graph splitting or enforcing memory constraints. These tools show what is happening, but don’t automatically change dataflow or subdivide large ops to avoid OOM. |
| **XLA flags that affect memory scheduling** | There are flags (in the “XLA Flags Guidance” section) that influence memory usage: things like choosing different memory schedulers, fusion strategies, scoping limits etc. For example “xla\_memory\_scheduler”, etc. [OpenXLA Project](https://openxla.org/xla/flags_guidance?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | These give control to users or to compiler engineers to tune memory behavior, but still do _not_ appear to implement full splitting of large operations or enforcing per-tensor limits automatically. More manual/configurable than automatic. |
| **SparseCore / specialized memory controls** | OpenXLA has features for “SparseCore” (for handling sparse or dynamic workloads), which includes static scratchpad memory sizing, serializing tables to reduce memory usage, etc. [OpenXLA Project](https://openxla.org/xla/sparsecore?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | These are closer to what eXLA wants: there _is_ logic for managing memory in dynamic/sparse work, and methods to reduce usage (e.g. via serialization). However, this is for very particular workloads (sparse, embedding/table lookups), not general matrix ops or arbitrary dataflow graphs. |
| **Sharding / partitioning frameworks** (“Shardy”, “Sharding Representation”, Sharding Propagation”) | OpenXLA supports partitioning of tensors across devices (sharding), representing and propagating those shardings through the graph, etc. [OpenXLA Project+2OpenXLA Project+2](https://openxla.org/shardy/sharding_representation?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Sharding gives a way to reduce memory footprint by splitting across devices. But this is different from _splitting within a single device’s memory budget_ by automatically subdividing huge operations. Also, sharding tends to assume multiple devices, whereas eXLA’s splitting works on single-device memory constraints. |

* * *

🛑 What I Did _Not_ Find / What Seems Missing
---------------------------------------------

These are important for assessing whether eXLA’s ideas have been adopted.

*   I **did not** find documentation showing that OpenXLA has incorporated an _automatic graph-splitting pass_ that enforces user-specified memory thresholds (like “if this tensor will exceed X MB, split across some axis” and insert loops etc.), as a general, framework-internal optimization.
*   I did _not_ find a flag in OpenXLA that corresponds to something like eXLA’s “--xla\_tensor\_size\_threshold” / “tensor\_split\_size” which triggers automatic splitting of large ops.
*   There is an open issue: “Expose memory space in general to JAX users” (#23152) indicating some interest in letting users annotate buffers/memory spaces. [GitHub](https://github.com/openxla/xla/issues/23152?utm_source=chatgpt.com) But that is more about visibility / ability to control memory usage rather than automatic enforcement or splitting.
*   Also an issue around “Horizontal loop fusion can increase memory consumption by order of magnitude” (#27322) is active. [GitHub](https://github.com/openxla/xla/issues/27322?utm_source=chatgpt.com) This suggests that some current fusion or optimization passes may unintentionally _increase_ memory use in some cases, which means memory optimization is nontrivial and not yet fully controlled.
*   No public commit or release note clearly states “we now split large matrix multiplies automatically to stay under memory limits” or similar.

✅ Conclusion: Has eXLA’s Key Novelty Been Adopted Yet?
------------------------------------------------------

Putting this together:

*   As of mid-2025, **OpenXLA has adopted many tools and flags to observe, profile, and give users more insight or control over memory usage**.
*   It has also integrated some workload-specific memory optimization (SparseCore, sharding, etc.).
*   However, I do _not_ see evidence that OpenXLA has (**yet**) adopted the _fully automatic memory-constraint enforcement / dataflow graph splitting_ as described in the eXLA paper, in the general case.

* * *

If you like, I can try to check the _latest commits_ of the OpenXLA GitHub repo to see if there's any work in progress or experimental branches implementing eXLA-style splitting. Do you want me to do that?
