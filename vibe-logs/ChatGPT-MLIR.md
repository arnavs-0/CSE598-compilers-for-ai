Walk me through MLIR whats up with the end of moores law reference?

## Response:
The ‚Äúend of Moore‚Äôs Law‚Äù reference in the MLIR paper‚Äôs title ‚Äî **‚ÄúMLIR: A Compiler Infrastructure for the End of Moore‚Äôs Law‚Äù** ‚Äî is more philosophical than literal, and it frames _why MLIR exists at all_.

Here‚Äôs the walkthrough:

* * *

### üß† **Background: Moore‚Äôs Law and Its End**

*   **Moore‚Äôs Law** predicted that transistor density (and roughly CPU performance) would double about every two years.
*   For decades, this drove performance gains _without requiring much change_ from software ‚Äî compilers could rely on general-purpose CPUs getting faster automatically.
*   But we‚Äôve now reached physical and economic limits: transistor scaling yields diminishing performance returns. The ‚Äúfree lunch‚Äù of automatic speedups from hardware scaling is over.

* * *

### ‚öôÔ∏è **What This Means for Compilers**

At the ‚Äúend of Moore‚Äôs Law,‚Äù performance improvements now depend on:

*   **Heterogeneous hardware:** CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, accelerators.
*   **Domain-specific optimization:** tailored compilation strategies for ML, HPC, etc.
*   **Cross-layer specialization:** optimizing across frameworks, IRs, and execution models.

Traditional compiler stacks (like LLVM or JVM) were designed for a single abstraction level (‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù). But now, every domain ‚Äî from machine learning graphs to high-performance kernels ‚Äî introduces its own intermediate representations (IRs). This creates fragmentation: duplicated effort, poor interoperability, and brittle, hard-to-extend toolchains.

* * *

### üí° **MLIR‚Äôs Core Idea**

MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is a response to this new hardware and software reality.  
It‚Äôs designed to:

*   **Unify diverse IRs** across domains and abstraction levels.
*   **Enable progressive lowering** ‚Äî gradually translating high-level operations (like tensor algebra) down to hardware instructions.
*   **Support domain-specific dialects** without rebuilding compiler infrastructure from scratch.

Essentially, MLIR aims to make compiler innovation feasible again _after_ Moore‚Äôs Law ‚Äî by reducing the engineering cost of adapting to new hardware and by providing a flexible, reusable infrastructure for all levels of abstraction.

* * *

### üß© **Why ‚Äúfor the End of Moore‚Äôs Law‚Äù**

The title captures the motivation:

> Hardware will no longer get faster ‚Äúfor free,‚Äù so the burden shifts to **software and compilers** to extract performance.

MLIR is meant to be the foundation for this new era ‚Äî where performance comes from smarter compilers and specialized hardware co-design, not just faster transistors.

* * *

### TL;DR

*   **Before:** Moore‚Äôs Law gave us automatic speedups ‚Üí one-size-fits-all compilers were fine.
*   **Now:** Hardware diversity and specialization ‚Üí compilers must evolve.
*   **MLIR‚Äôs mission:** Provide an extensible, multi-level compiler infrastructure _for the post-Moore‚Äôs-Law world_.

* * *

Would you like me to show where this motivation is implied in the paper‚Äôs introduction (e.g., how they link hardware heterogeneity and compiler fragmentation)?

## Prompt:
Can you explain how this mlir stuff works? Explain it to a person who is brand new to the compiler space, but is familiar with ML and CUDA

## Response:
Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great starting point, because **MLIR** was _literally born out of the ML and CUDA world_. Let‚Äôs walk through it step by step ‚Äî no compiler jargon, just intuition and concrete parallels to ML systems you already know.

* * *

üß© Big Picture: Why MLIR Exists
-------------------------------

Imagine you‚Äôre training a neural net in TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Under the hood, your model:

*   starts as a **Python computation graph** (`matmul`, `relu`, etc.),
*   gets turned into **lower-level code** that runs on GPU or TPU,
*   and finally becomes **machine instructions** (like CUDA kernels).

Each of those steps has its own intermediate representation (IR):

```
Python code  ‚Üí  TensorFlow Graph  ‚Üí  XLA HLO  ‚Üí  LLVM IR  ‚Üí  GPU machine code
```

That‚Äôs _five_ different IRs, and none of them talk to each other cleanly.  
They all reinvent the same wheel (parsers, optimizers, debuggers‚Ä¶).

So Chris Lattner (LLVM + Swift creator) and Google built **MLIR** to fix that mess.

* * *

üß† What MLIR Actually Is
------------------------

MLIR = **Multi-Level Intermediate Representation**.  
It‚Äôs not a single compiler ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **framework for building compilers**.

It gives you:

*   A **shared infrastructure** for parsing, validating, optimizing, and transforming code.
*   A way to define new _‚Äúdialects‚Äù_ ‚Äî custom sets of operations for your domain.
*   A way to connect high-level representations (like TensorFlow graphs) to low-level ones (like LLVM).

* * *

üöÄ Analogy: TensorFlow + CUDA
-----------------------------

Let‚Äôs connect this to what you already know.

| ML Concept | Compiler Analogy (in MLIR terms) |
| --- | --- |
| TensorFlow graph nodes (`MatMul`, `Add`, etc.) | High-level ‚ÄúOps‚Äù in an **MLIR Dialect** (e.g., `tf.MatMul`) |
| XLA optimizations (fusion, tiling) | **Passes** and **rewrites** that transform MLIR code |
| CUDA kernels | Low-level MLIR ‚Äúdialects‚Äù (e.g., GPU dialect or LLVM dialect) |
| CUDA PTX / SASS | The final output of MLIR lowering to LLVM or directly to PTX |

So you can think of MLIR as the ‚Äúglue compiler‚Äù that lets all these layers interoperate.

* * *

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works ‚Äî Step by Step
------------------------------

### 1\. **Everything is an Operation (Op)**

MLIR programs are made of **Ops**, like:

```
%1 = "math.add"(%x, %y) : (f32, f32) -> f32
```

That line means:

> ‚ÄúRun an operation called `math.add`, take two `float32` inputs, and produce one output.‚Äù

Ops can be high-level (like `tf.Conv2D`) or low-level (like `llvm.add`).

* * *

### 2\. **Dialects = Modular Layers**

Each domain (ML, CUDA, Tensor algebra, GPU, LLVM) defines its own _dialect_:

*   `tf` dialect for TensorFlow graphs
*   `affine` dialect for loop optimizations
*   `gpu` dialect for CUDA kernels
*   `llvm` dialect for final codegen

You can freely **mix dialects** in one program, like:

```mlir
%a = "tf.MatMul"(%x, %y)
%gpu_result = "gpu.launch"(%a)
```

That‚Äôs impossible in traditional compilers. MLIR makes it natural.

* * *

### 3\. **Progressive Lowering**

This is the _‚Äúmulti-level‚Äù_ in MLIR.

You start from high-level ops (say, a TensorFlow graph),  
then gradually _lower_ them step by step:

```
tf dialect ‚Üí linalg dialect ‚Üí affine dialect ‚Üí gpu dialect ‚Üí llvm dialect
```

Each step adds detail and removes abstraction ‚Äî like zooming from Python down to assembly ‚Äî but you can stop at any level.

For example, you could lower just to the GPU dialect to emit CUDA kernels, or go all the way down to LLVM IR for CPU code.

* * *

### 4\. **Pattern Rewriting**

MLIR makes it easy to define **optimization patterns**, like:

> Replace `x * 1` with `x`  
> Fuse `matmul` + `add` into `fused_matmul_add`

You write these as _rules_, not hand-coded C++.  
That‚Äôs how XLA, TensorRT, and even PyTorch 2.0‚Äôs backend can optimize more quickly.

* * *

### 5\. **Reusable Infrastructure**

Instead of every framework writing its own compiler passes (XLA, TVM, Glow, TensorRT‚Ä¶), MLIR gives everyone:

*   IR validators
*   parallel pass execution
*   debug info
*   SSA form (like in LLVM)
*   source tracking
*   dialect extensibility

So you get the benefits of LLVM-style rigor, but applied to the messy modern ML stack.

* * *

‚ö° Why It‚Äôs a Big Deal (Especially for ML/CUDA Folks)
----------------------------------------------------

At the _end of Moore‚Äôs Law_, we no longer get free speed from hardware.  
We have to:

*   build **custom accelerators** (TPUs, AI ASICs),
*   and **custom compilers** to target them.

MLIR makes building those compilers feasible.  
Instead of writing a whole compiler for your chip, you just:

1.  Define a dialect for your hardware,
2.  Reuse MLIR‚Äôs passes and infrastructure,
3.  Lower to LLVM or your custom backend.

That‚Äôs why NVIDIA, Google, AMD, and even Hugging Face are all using MLIR in their compiler stacks today (for CUDA Graphs, Triton, TensorRT, etc.).

* * *

üß≠ TL;DR Summary
----------------

| Traditional Compiler | MLIR Compiler Framework |
| --- | --- |
| One rigid IR (e.g., LLVM IR) | Many coexisting levels of IR (multi-level) |
| Hard to adapt for new hardware | Easy to extend with new dialects |
| Focused on CPU | Designed for heterogeneous accelerators |
| Monolithic & opaque | Modular, traceable, debuggable |
| Built for the Moore‚Äôs Law era | Built _for the end of_ Moore‚Äôs Law |

* * *

If you‚Äôre familiar with PyTorch 2.0‚Äôs **TorchInductor** or OpenAI‚Äôs **Triton**, they‚Äôre both _MLIR-like compilers_: they take high-level ML code and progressively lower it into optimized CUDA kernels.

Would you like me to show an example of how a simple PyTorch operation (like a matrix multiply) looks in MLIR form as it lowers from `torch` dialect ‚Üí `linalg` ‚Üí `gpu` dialect? That makes the idea super tangible.

## Prompt:
So is the goal of MLIR able to abstract ROCm and CUDA or something?

## Response:
üî• Excellent question ‚Äî and yes, you‚Äôre thinking _exactly_ in the right direction.

MLIR‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt just to abstract CUDA or ROCm specifically ‚Äî it‚Äôs to **make that kind of abstraction possible, portable, and efficient** without rewriting compilers from scratch every time a new accelerator shows up.

Let‚Äôs unpack that.

* * *

üß± The Problem MLIR Solves
--------------------------

### Before MLIR:

Each hardware stack has its own compiler ‚Äútower‚Äù:

```
PyTorch ‚Üí TorchScript ‚Üí CUDA kernels ‚Üí PTX ‚Üí GPU
TensorFlow ‚Üí XLA ‚Üí HLO ‚Üí LLVM ‚Üí TPU
HIP ‚Üí ROCm ‚Üí AMDGPU ISA
```

Each is its own little world ‚Äî different IRs, optimizers, debuggers, etc.  
If you want to support both **NVIDIA (CUDA)** and **AMD (ROCm)**, you essentially need _two completely separate_ compilation pipelines. üíÄ

* * *

üß© What MLIR Does Instead
-------------------------

MLIR lets you represent _all of those layers_ in **one shared infrastructure** built from _dialects_.

You can imagine it like LEGO blocks:

*   A **`linalg` dialect** for expressing high-level linear algebra (matmul, conv, etc.)
*   A **`gpu` dialect** for GPU concepts (threads, blocks, memory spaces)
*   A **`rocm` dialect** or **`cuda` dialect** for vendor-specific stuff (PTX vs GCN)
*   A **`llvm` dialect** for generating actual machine code

And you can plug these blocks together however you want:

```
torch dialect ‚Üí linalg dialect ‚Üí gpu dialect ‚Üí llvm dialect
                         ‚Ü≥ cuda dialect   ‚Ü≥ rocm dialect
```

That means your compiler could stay identical until the very last lowering stage ‚Äî and _only there_ pick whether to emit PTX (for CUDA) or GCN (for ROCm).

* * *

‚öôÔ∏è Example: Abstracting CUDA and ROCm
-------------------------------------

Say you have a matrix multiply:

```python
C = A @ B
```

You could compile it through MLIR like this:

```
torch.MatMul
  ‚Üì (lowering)
linalg.matmul  // hardware-independent math ops
  ‚Üì
gpu.launch     // threads, blocks, shared memory
  ‚Üì
  ‚Ü≥ cuda dialect ‚Üí PTX
  ‚Ü≥ rocm dialect ‚Üí AMD GCN
```

The top half (PyTorch ‚Üí `linalg` ‚Üí `gpu`) is _identical_ for both backends.  
Only the final dialect differs ‚Äî that‚Äôs the ‚Äúabstract ROCm/CUDA‚Äù magic.

* * *

üß† Why It Matters
-----------------

*   You can write **one compiler** that targets _many_ backends (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc.).
*   You can **fuse**, **tile**, or **vectorize** ops _before_ you commit to a vendor backend.
*   You can even **mix dialects**: use CUDA for one kernel and ROCm for another in the same MLIR module.

This is _huge_ for ML frameworks ‚Äî it‚Äôs exactly how projects like:

*   **TensorFlow XLA (rewritten on MLIR)**
*   **PyTorch‚Äôs Torch-MLIR**
*   **IREE** (Google‚Äôs runtime for deploying ML models across CPU/GPU/TPU)
*   **LLVM‚Äôs AMDGPU and NVPTX backends**

‚Ä¶can share infrastructure instead of duplicating effort.

* * *

üöÄ So, to your question directly:
---------------------------------

> Is MLIR‚Äôs goal to abstract ROCm and CUDA?

‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî in spirit.**  
It provides the _mechanism_ for abstracting over different GPU ecosystems.  
You can define a common high-level GPU dialect that represents concepts like:

*   `gpu.launch`
*   `gpu.thread_id`
*   `gpu.block_id`
*   `gpu.shared_memory`

Then have _different dialects or lowerings_ that map those to:

*   **PTX / SASS** (NVIDIA CUDA)
*   **ROCm GCN / HSAIL** (AMD)
*   **SPIR-V** (Vulkan, OpenCL)
*   **Metal / WebGPU**, etc.

That‚Äôs how MLIR enables **write-once, lower-anywhere** compilation.

* * *

üß© TL;DR Summary
----------------

| Layer | Traditional Approach | MLIR Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPU vendor support | Separate code paths for CUDA, ROCm, etc. | Shared pipeline until final dialect lowering |
| Abstraction level | Fixed (e.g., LLVM IR) | Multi-level (from Tensor ops ‚Üí GPU threads ‚Üí LLVM) |
| Portability | Painful (custom compiler per backend) | Built-in via dialects |
| Example output | PTX for NVIDIA | PTX, GCN, SPIR-V, or custom accelerator ISA |

* * *

Would you like me to show an example of how one MLIR GPU dialect op (like `gpu.launch`) can be lowered to both PTX _and_ ROCm-style code, so you can see the abstraction in action?

## Prompt:
so how is MLIR being used today? Give me a few examples

## Response:
Great question ‚Äî yes, MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is _already_ being used **widely** across industry and research. Below are **three concrete examples** (spanning ML, hardware, and domain-specific compilation) that illustrate how MLIR is being used today, followed by a couple of ‚Äúbonus‚Äù shorter mentions for flavor.

* * *

### 1\. IREE ‚Äî ML models to multiple hardware backends

![https://iree.dev/assets/images/IREE_Logo_Icon_Color.svg](https://iree.dev/assets/images/IREE_Logo_Icon_Color.svg)

![https://iree.dev/assets/images/iree_architecture.svg](https://iree.dev/assets/images/iree_architecture.svg)

6

**What it is:** IREE is a compiler + minimal runtime system intended for compiling ML models (e.g., from TensorFlow or TFLite) and executing them on a variety of devices: CPUs, GPUs, optionally other accelerators. According to the MLIR ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù list, IREE is listed among users of MLIR. [mlir.llvm.org+1](https://mlir.llvm.org/users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
**How MLIR is used:**

*   The front‚Äêend (model representation) is lowered into MLIR dialects (for example tensor / linalg dialects).
*   MLIR passes (transformations, optimizations) apply to these dialects: fusion, tiling, bufferization, lowering.
*   Finally, MLIR lowers to target‚Äêspecific backends (like GPU, CPU) possibly via LLVM or GPU dialects.  
    **Why this matters:** Because ML models need portability across hardware (embedded, mobile, server, etc.), having a shared infrastructure (MLIR) lets IREE reuse much of the compilation stack and only plug in hardware‚Äêtarget-specific bits.

* * *

### 2\. ONNX‚ÄëMLIR ‚Äî Interoperable ML model representation and compilation

6

**What it is:** ONNX-MLIR is a compiler toolchain that takes models represented in the ONNX format and compiles them through MLIR for execution on different hardware (x86, Power, mainframes, accelerators) as noted in the MLIR user list. [mlir.llvm.org](https://mlir.llvm.org/users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
**How MLIR is used:**

*   ONNX net (graph of tensor ops) ‚Üí MLIR representation (in some ONNX dialect or conversion)
*   Then MLIR transformations/optimizations happen (fusion, graph rewrites, hardware target lowering)
*   Then ultimately code is generated for the target hardware.  
    **Why this matters:** ONNX is a widely‚Äêused format for sharing ML models. ONNX-MLIR shows how MLIR helps bridge from a high‚Äêlevel representation (ONNX) into efficient target code, reusing a lot of infrastructure.

* * *

### 3\. MLIR‚ÄëAIE (Xilinx/AMD AI Engine toolchain) ‚Äî Custom hardware accelerator support

6

**What it is:** MLIR-AIE is a toolchain developed for AMD/Xilinx‚Äôs AI Engine (AIE) hardware. It uses MLIR infrastructure to target this custom accelerator. [GitHub+1](https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
**How MLIR is used:**

*   Developers define MLIR dialects specific to the AI hardware‚Äôs features (tiles, streaming engines, etc.).
*   They use MLIR lowering from more generic computational IRs down to hardware‚Äêspecific ops.
*   They exploit MLIR‚Äôs infrastructure for transformations and then generate code/configuration for the AIE hardware.  
    **Why this matters:** One of MLIR‚Äôs core motivations is supporting **heterogeneous hardware** and custom accelerators at the ‚Äúend of Moore‚Äôs Law‚Äù. This is a direct real‚Äêworld case: custom accelerator ‚Üí MLIR ‚Üí target toolchain.

* * *

### Why these examples matter for you (ML + CUDA you're familiar with)

Since you‚Äôre familiar with ML and CUDA, here‚Äôs how these map to things you care about:

*   When you write a model (e.g., in PyTorch/TensorFlow) and want it to run on GPU or a custom accelerator, MLIR provides the infrastructure to go **from high‚Äêlevel ops ‚Üí optimised code for GPU/accelerator**.
*   If you‚Äôre working in CUDA (NVIDIA) or another GPU stack (e.g., AMD/ROCm or a custom tensor accelerator), MLIR lets you define common ‚Äúdialects‚Äù for tensor operations (matmul, conv, etc.), and then lower to vendor‚Äêspecific backend while reusing much of the compiler logic.
*   If you want to build or customise your own ML kernel (say, a fused matmul+relu+add that‚Äôs tuned for your hardware), MLIR gives you the ‚Äúcompiler scaffold‚Äù (IR, transformations, lowering framework) rather than writing everything from scratch.

* * *

If you like, I can pull together **5 more detailed case studies** (with links and deeper technical read‚Äêouts) of how MLIR is used in production (especially in ML frameworks + GPU/accelerator backends) so you can see ‚Äúreal code‚Äù flows. Would you like me to dig those up?

## Prompt:
MLIR vs LLVM

## Response:
Excellent question ‚Äî this is one of the **core conceptual distinctions** in modern compiler design.  
Let‚Äôs break it down clearly, especially from your background in ML and CUDA.

* * *

üß© Short Answer
---------------

**LLVM** = one _level_ of IR (close to hardware, CPU/GPU backend).  
**MLIR** = a _framework_ for creating **many** IRs (multi-level, domain-specific, customizable).

MLIR _builds on_ LLVM ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt replace it.  
In fact, LLVM IR is just _one dialect_ inside MLIR.

* * *

üß† Analogy: Think of it like Deep Learning Frameworks
-----------------------------------------------------

| Concept | ML Analogy |
| --- | --- |
| **LLVM** | cuDNN ‚Äî a fast, specialized library for low-level ops (you can use it directly, but it‚Äôs not easy to extend). |
| **MLIR** | PyTorch ‚Äî a flexible framework where you can define your own layers (dialects) and transformations (passes), and even target cuDNN underneath. |

LLVM is specialized and fixed.  
MLIR is modular, extensible, and meant to handle **the whole stack**.

* * *

‚öôÔ∏è Where LLVM Fits
------------------

LLVM provides:

*   **A single, low-level IR** (LLVM IR ‚Äî kind of ‚ÄúC with vectors‚Äù)
*   **Code generation** for CPUs, GPUs, etc.
*   Optimizations like inlining, register allocation, loop unrolling
*   Mature backends for many architectures (x86, ARM, NVPTX, AMDGPU, etc.)

It‚Äôs designed for _compiling general-purpose languages_ like C/C++, Swift, Rust.

But‚Ä¶ it struggles when:

*   You want to optimize **tensors**, not scalars.
*   You need **multi-level transformations** (e.g., tensor fusion before loop unrolling).
*   You‚Äôre working with **heterogeneous hardware** (CPU + GPU + accelerator).

* * *

‚öôÔ∏è Where MLIR Fits
------------------

MLIR was **created by the LLVM team** (Chris Lattner et al.)  
to solve the modern ‚Äúpost-Moore‚Äôs Law‚Äù problem:

> Performance now depends on specialized hardware, not just CPUs.

So MLIR provides:

*   **A framework** to _define your own IRs (dialects)_ ‚Äî e.g., for TensorFlow, GPU kernels, or DSPs.
*   **Infrastructure** for passes, rewrites, verifiers, and lowering pipelines.
*   **Multi-level lowering** ‚Äî high-level tensor ops ‚Üí mid-level loops ‚Üí low-level instructions ‚Üí LLVM IR.

Then you can hand it off to LLVM for final codegen:

```
TensorFlow graph ‚Üí linalg dialect ‚Üí affine dialect ‚Üí gpu dialect ‚Üí llvm dialect ‚Üí machine code
```

* * *

üß© Example: Matrix Multiply Path
--------------------------------

Let‚Äôs compare how the same operation would flow.

### üîπ LLVM

```c
for (i) for (j) for (k)
  C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
```

LLVM sees:

*   Loops
*   Loads/stores
*   Floating-point multiplies and adds

It can optimize loops and registers, but has _no clue_ these are matrix multiplies ‚Äî you‚Äôve already lost high-level semantics.

* * *

### üîπ MLIR

```mlir
%res = linalg.matmul ins(%A, %B : tensor<16x16xf32>, tensor<16x16xf32>)
                     outs(%C : tensor<16x16xf32>)
```

MLIR sees:

*   It‚Äôs a **matmul**, not just loops.
*   It can apply **domain-specific rewrites**: fusion, tiling, tensor layout transforms.
*   It can progressively lower:
    ```
    linalg.matmul ‚Üí affine loops ‚Üí gpu.launch ‚Üí llvm.addf/mulf ‚Üí PTX/SASS
    ```

Each level preserves meaning until it‚Äôs no longer needed.

* * *

üß© Architectural View
---------------------

| Aspect | LLVM | MLIR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Optimize and codegen for general-purpose languages | Framework to build new compilers / IRs for all domains |
| **Abstraction level** | Low (machine-oriented) | Multi-level (high ‚Üî low) |
| **Extensibility** | Fixed IR design | Arbitrary user-defined dialects |
| **High-level semantics** | Lost early | Preserved until needed |
| **Target hardware** | CPU/GPU backends | Heterogeneous systems (CPU, GPU, TPU, FPGA, DSP, etc.) |
| **Relationship** | End target | Often the _final stage_ of MLIR lowering |

* * *

üß† Mental Model
---------------

```
[ Python / TensorFlow / C++ / DSL ]
           ‚Üì
     [ MLIR (multi-level)]
  Tensor dialects ‚Üí GPU dialect ‚Üí LLVM dialect
           ‚Üì
       [ LLVM IR ]
           ‚Üì
   [ Machine code: PTX, GCN, x86, etc. ]
```

So MLIR _feeds into_ LLVM ‚Äî not replaces it.

* * *

üí° Real-World Examples of the MLIR‚ÄìLLVM Relationship
----------------------------------------------------

*   **Torch-MLIR** ‚Üí lowers PyTorch graphs ‚Üí MLIR ‚Üí LLVM IR ‚Üí native code.
*   **TensorFlow XLA** ‚Üí rewritten on MLIR ‚Üí uses LLVM for final codegen.
*   **IREE** ‚Üí MLIR pipeline ‚Üí LLVM for CPU/GPU execution.
*   **Flang** (Fortran frontend) ‚Üí MLIR ‚Üí LLVM backend.
*   **CIRCT** (hardware compiler) ‚Üí MLIR dialects for Verilog/VHDL ‚Üí hardware generation.

All use LLVM as the ‚Äúbottom layer‚Äù and MLIR for everything above it.

* * *

‚ö° TL;DR
-------

|  | LLVM | MLIR |

Would you like me to show a visual diagram of how MLIR and LLVM connect inside a real system (like TensorFlow or PyTorch ‚Üí MLIR ‚Üí LLVM ‚Üí GPU)? It really helps cement how the layers flow together.

## Prompt:
create a diagram of how mlir works

## Prompt:
is there a successor to mlir yet?

## Response:
There‚Äôs **no well-established ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù to MLIR yet** in the sense of a fully-replaced or next-generation IR framework that has overtaken it. However, there _are_ interesting adjacent developments and alternatives worth knowing about ‚Äî here‚Äôs a breakdown.

* * *

‚úÖ MLIR is still very much active
--------------------------------

*   MLIR is being used broadly (in ML compilers, hardware DSLs, heterogeneous accelerators) and remains under active development. [mlir.llvm.org+3mlir.llvm.org+3Medium+3](https://mlir.llvm.org/users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   There‚Äôs no official roadmap announcing ‚Äúend of MLIR‚Äù or ‚ÄúMLIR v2‚Äù yet.

* * *

üß© Emerging alternatives / related projects
-------------------------------------------

While not direct successors, some projects aim to solve similar problems or build on MLIR ideas:

*   Pliron: A new IR framework written in Rust that positions itself as ‚ÄúMLIR-but native Rust‚Äù. It is still early/incomplete. [Rust Internals](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pliron-mlir-but-native-rust/22563?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   Domain-specific enhancements built _on top of_ MLIR: e.g., new MLIR dialects for equality saturation (e-graphs) in ‚Äúeqsat‚Äù work. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09363?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   Projects targeting novel compilation flows (e.g., WebAssembly via MLIR) rather than replacing MLIR altogether. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16048?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

üß† Key reasons why a ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù hasn‚Äôt emerged (yet)
-----------------------------------------------------

*   MLIR is itself fairly new (released ~2019) but already mature in many domains. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLIR_%28software%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   It solves a hard problem (heterogeneous hardware, multi-level lowering) and many toolchains are already built on it ‚Äî switching wholesale is expensive.
*   Any ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù would need broad ecosystem buy-in (dialects, tooling, optimizers) which takes time.

* * *

üîç What ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù might look like (if/when it happens)
--------------------------------------------------------

Such a framework might include:

*   Even stronger **hardware-agnostic abstractions** (higher-level than current MLIR dialects)
*   More built-in support for **graph/IR transforms** specialized for ML/accelerator workloads
*   Native support in safer languages (Rust, etc) rather than C++
*   Simpler APIs for domain-specific compilers/accelerators so fewer boilerplate steps

* * *

If you like, I can check **ongoing research** (2024-25) for proposals explicitly titled ‚ÄúMLIR v2‚Äù or ‚Äúnext-gen IR‚Äù and see which ones are gaining traction. Would that be interesting?
